## Diversity and Inclusion
There is a large gender gap among men and women in the tech industry, especially in technical roles.
- Some have traced this back to the 80's when the trend of gaming in the computing community became very closely tied together.  With that most of the games were geared towards men and boys, so it was easy for boys to get a leg up in that area through gaming.  Studies showed that early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates “more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects.” 
### Why diversity matters to tech companies
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. 
Five reasons why diversity matters:
  1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.  hey bring more and different ways of seeing problems, and thus better and faster ways to solve them.
  2. Diverse companies perform better.
  3. Companies are losing out on great talent.
  4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.  
  5. It's the right thing to do!
